# Process

This file aims to provide insight in the progression of this project. Each day, there will be a short write-up on what has been done and which challenges we faced individually and collectively.

On the first day we immersed ourselves in the Rush Hour case. We played a few games of Rush Hour and got a good understanding what kind of challenges we would face if we tried to program a Rush Hour solving algorithm.

Tasks done:

* Programmed a matrix (essentially a list of lists) in Python; each point/letter represents (part of) a car/truck. 
* Brainstorm session on which algorithms would be useful to solve a Rush Hour game.

Challenges faced & discovered:
* When should the algorithm move the red car backwards?
* Should we implement a log/memory feature to remember the moves of the car?

Eventually we realized we have to verify the output in a uniform manner.
